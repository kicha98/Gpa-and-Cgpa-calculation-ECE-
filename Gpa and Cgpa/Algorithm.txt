Algorithm

 Step: 1 grade system 
I have initiated some dummy strings ( s,a,b,c,d,e) and used strcmp function to compare the given grade with dummy string if they are same corresponding grade points multiplied with corresponding credit and this answer in stored variable "points".

Step: 2 GPA for one semester 
Using "switch case”  I used to obtain different grades for different subjects. Case of switch contains different subjects.

Switch (choice)
{Case 1:
{ (subject) 
Grade system}} 

And using GPA formula calculate GPA of that semester

Step: 3 GPA for all semester

Now I used main switch case for all semesters. And insert GPA calculation for single semester (step :2) in case of the main switch case . See the code for reference

Switch (sem selection)
{Case 1: ( sem 1)
Switch (choice)
{ Case 1:
{ (subject) 
Grade system}}
}

Step: 4 final code
Finally before this main switch statement, I used strcmp function to compare given string is GPA or CGPA then it probably continue with the option that you have given by GPA and CGPA formulas
